/* Example of initilization:
PushButton myButton(75, 500, 150, 1);	//example of how to set the button
DeadDuration is set to 150ms
longDurationThreshold is set to 500ms
debounceThreshold is set to 75ms
pressed voltage state is HIGH 1
    
output: 0 nothing, noise or bounce    
    ____                            
____|  |____________________________
    50ms < DeadDuration : output 0           
    
    
output: 1 pressed and held for a long time and not released yet
output: 2 released aftera a long time
     ____________________________________________________
  __|                                                    |________
  700ms > longDurationThreshold : output 1    when released output : 2
  notiec that when output 1 is produced, output 2 will be produced later necessarily.
output: 3, 4 and more respectively: A click, double click, three clicks, ...
     _______ 
_____|     |___________________
    100ms :  A clicl because it is low after the click for DeadDuration
    
     _______            _______ 
_____|     |____________|     |______
             The gap is less than DeadDuration and it is a double click
and so on
