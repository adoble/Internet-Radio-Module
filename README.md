# Modular Audio Project - Internet Radio Module

An internet radio source that (eventually) should  communicate with the other modules (such as the amplifier) using I2S (or something similar).

This version still communicates with an existing amplifier by using an I2S DAC.

Uses the [ESP8266Audio](https://github.com/earlephilhower/ESP8266Audio) library from [Earle F. Philhower](https://github.com/earlephilhower)
